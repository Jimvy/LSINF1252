    In this exercise, we will work with operation on bits. When we speak about the position of a bit, the index 0 corresponds to weakest bit, 1 to the second-weakest bit, ...

    In c, you can write a number in a binary (base 2) form by prefixing it via 0b.
    e.g. 0b11010 = 26 (base 10)

    Note: numbers begin by 0 are stored in octal (base 8).
    e.g. 022 (base 8) = 18 (base 10)

    This exercise will introduce some non-standard data types which guarantee that the variable has a fixed number of bits. Indeed, on some machines, a *int* could be 2, 4 or 8 bytes. Hence, if we want to do bitwise operations, we have to know first on how many bits we are working.

    To do so, we introduce a new classe of variable types :

    * *int8_t* (signed integer of 8 bits), *uint8_t* (unsigned integer of 8 bits), *uint16_t* (unsigned integer of 16 bits) ... (you can mix *uint* or *int* with bit-lengths 8, 16, 32 and 64). (from <stdint.h>).

            Write the body of a function *unset_strong_bit*, which sets to 0 the strongest bit set to 1 it founds, and does nothing if there's no bit set to 0.

            e.g. unset_strong_bit(0b000111010101010)=0b000011010101010
