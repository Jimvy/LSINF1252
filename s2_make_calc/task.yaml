    You have just built a simple calculator. When typing ``ls`` in your command line, the source folder has the following structure:

    .. code-block:: console

        calc.c    calc.h    operations.c    operations.h

    ``calc.c`` contains the calculator which handles the 4 basic operations: addition, substraction, multiplication, and division. These 4 operations are implemented in ``operations.c``.

    As you might have noticed, there are also two other files: ``calc.h`` and ``operations.h``. These are the corresponding **header** files of ``calc.c`` and ``operations.c``.

    These headers contain the function prototypes and specifications. For instance ``double add(double a, double b);``.

    Unfortunately, the source folder was lost but you still have access to the object files.
