    You have just built a simple calculator. When typing ``ls`` in your command line, the source folder has the following structure:

    .. code-block:: console

        calc.c    calc.h    operations.c    operations.h    Makefile

    ``calc.c`` contains the calculator which handles the 4 basic operations: addition, substraction, multiplication, and division. These 4 operations are implemented in ``operations.c``.

    As you might have noticed, there are also two other files: ``calc.h`` and ``operations.h``. These are the corresponding **header** files of ``calc.c`` and ``operations.c``. These headers contain the function prototypes and specifications, but not their definitions. They can also contain ``extern`` declarations of variables. For more on that, see `this page <https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_header_files.htm>`_ or chapter 4 in [kernighan2006c]_.

    When compiling this calculator, you need to specify in the ``Makefile`` rules the header files needed by ``calc.c``, that is both ``calc.h`` and ``operations.h``.

            Unfortunately, for some obscure reasons the source folder (including the precious ``Makefile``) was lost but you still have access to the object files.

            Write a *Makefile* rule to build the executable ``calc`` from both object files ``calc.o`` and ``operations.o``. That is, you want to *link* the object files into the executable.

            **Hints:** You do not need to write the rules for ``operations.o`` and ``calc.o``. Do not forget the prerequisites of your rule. You cannot use *implicit* rules, you must use *explicit* rules.

            Now, you just remembered you had created a ``git`` *repository* for this calculator on a *remote server*. You ``clone`` it on your computer, and verify each file with the command line editor ``nano``. You notice the ``Makefile`` is incomplete. There are no recipes to build the object files!

            Write *Makefile* rules to build the object files ``calc.o`` and ``operations.o`` from the source files.

            **Hints:** Do not forget the prerequisites of your rule. You cannot use *implicit* rules, you must use *explicit* rules.
