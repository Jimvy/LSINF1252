            Remember the `calculator <
            https://inginious.info.ucl.ac.be/course/LSINF1252-2018/s02_make_calc>`_ you had to make last week?

            When you typed ``ls`` you had the following folder structure:

            .. code-block:: console

                calc.c    calc.h    operations.c    operations.h

            Write a variable called ``OBJ`` to simplify the compilation process in the Makefile.
        answer: OBJ = calc.o operations.o
