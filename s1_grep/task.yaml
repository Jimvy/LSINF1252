context: The `grep(1) command <https://sites.uclouvain.be/SystInfo/manpages/man1/grep.1.html>`_
    can be use to detect or extract lots of information from text files. When working
    with source code,  You'll use it on the file architecture downloadable `grep(1)
    <https://sites.uclouvain.be/SystInfo/manpages/man1/grep.1.html>`_ can help you
    to find in which files some functions or constants have been defined. For this
    exercise, we will use the source code of the `CUnit <http://cunit.sourceforge.net>`_
    testing framework that you can download as a `tar archive  <https://inginious.info.ucl.ac.be/course/LSINF1252-2018/s1_grep/CUnit.tar>`_.
