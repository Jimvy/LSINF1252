context: An integer pointer, ``int* a``, is given to you. You are asked to find special
    datas from this pointer. A hacker from Anonymous gave you a function, ``fun(int
    a, int b, int c)``, which can give the answer of life and which takes three arguments
    you have to find with the pointer.

problems:
    first:
        language: c
        name: First argument
        header: |-
            The first argument for your function is the integer located at the 13rd Byte of the pointer. You have to implement ``first`` function which give that number.

            .. code-block:: c

                int first(int* a){
                    //Your code will be inserted here
                }
        type: code
    second:
        name: Second argument
        header: |-
            For the second argument, you have to find the stocked value at the 6th Byte of the pointer. You have to implement ``second`` function which give that number.

            .. code-block:: c

                int second(int* a){
                    //Your code will be inserted here
                }
        type: code
        language: c
    third:
        language: c
        type: code
        name: Third argument
        header: |-
            For the third argument, you have to find the integer located at the 11st Byte of the pointer. You have to implement ``third`` function which give that number.

            .. code-block:: c

                int third(int* a){
                    //Your code will be inserted here
                }
