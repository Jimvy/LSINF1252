    A hacker wanted to challenge you and encrypted your hard drive. To unlock your drive, he gave you a function ``get_key(int a, int b, int c)`` which returns the decryption key if the correct parameters are given.

    He then hid the parameters *a*, *b* and *c* in memory, and gave you a pointer from which you can retrieve these parameters.

            You found a hint from the hacker, telling the first paramater is  located at the 13rd byte after pointer. You have to implement ``first`` function which give that number.

            Write the body of the function *first* :

            .. code-block:: c

                int first(void *ptr) {
        type: code
    second:
        name: Second argument
        header: |-
            For the second argument, you have to find the stocked value at the 6th Byte of the pointer. You have to implement ``second`` function which give that number.

            .. code-block:: c

                int second(int* a){
                    //Your code will be inserted here
                }
        type: code
        language: c
    third:
        language: c
        type: code
        name: Third argument
        header: |-
            For the third argument, you have to find the integer located at the 11st Byte of the pointer. You have to implement ``third`` function which give that number.

            .. code-block:: c

                int third(int* a){
                    //Your code will be inserted here
                }
