    Pointers to functions can be used to handle functions in a dynamic fashion, and will be of great importance later in this course. It is hence important to grasp how they work.

    In this exercise, you will code a function which receives pointers to two functions, to determine if these functions are equivalent. Two functions are equivalent if they produce the same output for the same input.

    The functions passed by pointers will be of the form ``uint8_t func(uint8_t n)``.

            Write the function *cmp_func* (prototype and body), which receives two pointers to functions (described as above), and returns an int, containing 1 if the functions are equivalent, else 0. Test the comparison for all the values

            Reminder: value of an *uint8_t* is between 0 and 255.
