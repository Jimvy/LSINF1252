context: Given the provided implementation of a linked list, you are asked to implement
    the ``insert`` function based on a specific order relation. By succeeding this
    task, you will be able to make ordered list like a `Comparator` in `java`.

        name: Order relation
        header: |-
            For this subproblem, you are asked to implement the comparison function which rules the order relation of the list.

            .. code-block:: c

                /*
                * @return: 0 if equals, -1 if @other is greater and 1 if @this is greater
                */
                int compare(char this, char other){
                    //Your code will be inserted here
                }
        language: c
    insert:
        name: Insert
        header: |-
            For this subproblem, you have the template of the structure node:

            .. code-block:: c

                typedef struct node{
                    char val;
                    node_t* next;
                } node_t;

            Starting from this structure, you are asked to implement the following function

            .. code-block:: c

                /*
                * @value: value to be inserted. If the value is already in the list, don't reinsert it.
                * @fun: comparison function which rules the order relation of the list
                * @head: first node of the list
                * @return: 0 if success, -1 otherwise
                */
                int insert(node_t** head, char value, int (*fun)(char,char)){
                    //Your code will be inserted here
                }
