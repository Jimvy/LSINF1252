context: Given the provided implementation of a linked list, you are asked to implement
    the ``insert`` function based on a specific order relation. The goal is to implement
    an ordered list like type, much like a `LinkedList` with a `Comparator` in Java.

        type: code

            For this subproblem, you are asked to implement the comparison function which rules the order relation of the list.

            Write the body of the function *compare*.

            .. code-block:: c

                /*
                * @return: 0 if equals, negative number if @b is greater,
                * and positive number otherwise
                */
                int compare(char a, char b) {
    insert:
        header: |
            Given the following linked list structure :

            .. code-block:: c

                typedef struct node{
                    char val;
                    node_t *next;
                } node_t;

            Write the body of the function *insert*.

            .. code-block:: c

                /*
                * @value: value to be inserted. If the value is already in the list, don't reinsert it.
                * @fun: comparison function which rules the order relation of the list
                * @head: first node of the list, head != NULL
                * @return: 0 if success, -1 otherwise
                */
                int insert(node_t **head, char val, int (*cmp)(char,char)) {
