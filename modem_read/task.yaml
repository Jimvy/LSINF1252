    Back in 1977, you want to read your e-mail with your freshly bought Apple II. You are connected to the ARPANET through a modem, but unfortunately the modem's manufacturer has only given a single function ``modem_read``, to read the data received by the modem, with the following prototype :

    ``void modem_read(void *buffer, int *buf_len);``

    This function fills the supplied buffer with the data received from the modem (an array of ``char``), and writes the number of bytes written to the value pointed by ``buf_len``. It can write up to maximum 256 bytes in a single call. This function is guaranteed to return.

            You want to know if the information that you received from the modem you received contains a byte whose numerical value is ``42``.
            Write the body of the function ``has_42``, this function has to use ``malloc`` to create the buffer before calling ``modem_read``:

            .. code-block:: c

                /*
                 * @return: 1 if the modem received a byte containing 42
                 *         else 0, -1 if an error has happened.
                 */
                int has_42() {
