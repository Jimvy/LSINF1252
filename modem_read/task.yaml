    You are in 1977 and want to read your e-mail with your freshly bought Apple II. You are connected to the ARPANET through a modem, but unfortunately the modem's manufacturer has only given a single function `modem_read`, to read the data received by the modem, with the following prototype :

    ``void modem_read(void *buffer, int *buf_len);``

    It fills the given buffer with the data received from the modem, and write the number of bytes written to the value pointed by *buf_len* is 255 bytes.
