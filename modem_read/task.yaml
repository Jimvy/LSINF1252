    You are in 1977 and want to read your e-mail with your freshly bought Apple II. You are connected to the ARPANET through a modem, but unfortunately the modem's manufacturer has only given a single function `modem_read`, to read the data received by the modem, with the following prototype :

    ``void modem_read(void *buffer, int *buf_len);``

    It fills the given buffer with the data received from the modem, and writes the number of bytes written to the value pointed by *buf_len*. It can write up to maximum 256 bytes in a single call. This function is guaranteed to succeed.

            You want to know if one e-mail you received contains the byte 42.
            Write the body of the function *has_42*, this function has to use *malloc* to create the buffer :

            .. code-block:: c

                /* has_42
                 * @return: 1 if the modem received a byte containing 42, else 0, -1 if an error has happened.
                int has_42() {
