    You are currently processing an array composed of ``struct point`` defined below. In this programme, you need to store the content of the entire array in a file to be able to reuse it later. Write a C function to write the array composed of ``struct point`` into a file. The file may already exist or not. After the execution of the function, the file should only contain the array. If the file has to be created, the user who created it must have the permission to read it.

    .. code-block:: c

        typedef struct point {
            int x;
            int y;
            int z;
        } point_t;

    Use only ``open(2)``, ``write(2)`` and ``close(2)``. You can only call ``write(2)`` once.

    Hint : read carefully the man page of ``open(2)`` to manage all the  cases mentionned above.
