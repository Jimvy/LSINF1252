    You get and `input <https://inginious.info.ucl.ac.be/course/LSINF1252-2018/s1_pipes/input.txt>`_ from where you want to extract an ordered exhaustive list of unique hashtags. For this, you should use pipes. To extract hashtags from the text you can either use ``sed '/ [^{#}]/d'`` or `grep(1) <https://sites.uclouvain.be/SystInfo/manpages/man1/grep.1.html>`_.
