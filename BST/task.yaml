    For this task, you will implement a binary search on a binary tree. A binary tree has the following structure:

    .. image:: BST/bst.png
        :height: 340px
        :width: 540px
        :scale: 100%


    For this, you have the code of the node stucture:

    .. code-block:: c

        /*
        * Node has a value, @value, and two children, @left and @right.
        * All the children of @left and @left have a smaller value then the node and all the children of @right and @right have a bigger value then node
        */
        typedef struct node{
            int value;
            struct node* left;
            struct node* right;
        } node_t;

    And you have the code of the binary structure:

    .. code-block:: c

        typedef struct bt{
            struct node* root;
        } bt_t;
