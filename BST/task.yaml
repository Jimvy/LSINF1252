    For this task, you will implement a simple binary search on an existing binary tree. A binary tree has the following structure:

    .. image:: BST/bst.png
        :height: 340px
        :width: 540px
        :scale: 100%


    This binary tree is composed of nodes implemented using the following structure.

    .. code-block:: c

        /*
        * Node has a value, @value, and two children, @left and @right.
        * All the children of @left and itself have a smaller value than the node and all the children of @right and itself have a larger value than node
        */
        typedef struct node{
            int value;
            struct node* left; // to smaller values
            struct node* right; // to larger values
        } node_t;

    The binary tree itself is defined as follows.

    .. code-block:: c

        typedef struct bt{
            struct node* root;
        } bt_t;
