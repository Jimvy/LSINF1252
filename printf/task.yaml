            The function ``printf`` writes data to the standard output stream (*stdout*).

            Write the body of the function *print_foo* which will print "foo\n" (without the quotes, the symbol '\n' represents a **line feed**, i.e. the end of a line) to *stdout*.

            .. code-block:: c

                void print_foo() {
        name: Foo
        type: code
        language: c
    digit:
        name: Digital
        language: c
        header: |-
            ``printf`` can also print the content of a variable. Write the body of the function *print_digit*.

            .. code-block:: c

                /* print_digit
                 * @n: an integer
                 *
                 * result: print to stdout "The magic number is NUMBER.\n"
                 */
                void print_digit(int number) {
        type: code
    example:
        name: Floating away
        answer: '3.1415'
        header: |
            ``printf`` is a powerful formatting tool which can handle several data types, and several formatting parameters.

            What would the following call print to *stdout* ?

            .. code-block:: c

                float PI = 3.1415926;
                printf("pi = %.4f", PI);
        type: match
    sprintf:
        language: c
        name: sprintf
        type: code
        header: |
            ``sprintf(2)`` is a variant of ``printf(2)`` which doesn't write to *stdout*, but instead writes to a *buffer*.

            Write the body of the function *format_str*.

            .. code-block:: c

                /* format_str, example:
                 * format_str(buf, 42, "Olivier", 'B') will write into buf
                 * the string "Mister Olivier B. has 42 eggs" (no line feed)
                 * The given buffer is guaranteed to be big enough.
                 */
                char *format_str(char *buffer, unsigned int d, char *name, char initial) {
