    Given the following structure *univrsity_t*:

    .. code-block:: c

        typedef struct university {
            char* city;
            int creation;
            person_t* rector;
        } university_t;

    And the structure *person_t*:

    .. code-block:: c

        typedef struct person {
            char* name;
            int salary;
            int age;
        } person_t;

    You are asked to implement the functions ``free_all`` and ``init_all``, which respectively initializes the structure *universiy_t* and frees all the memory associated with it.

    The *name* and the *city* have been allocated with *malloc*.

    *Hint:* all the data may not have been initialised correctly. Therefore, you have to handle all the cases (e.g. some pointers can be already NULL, and don't need to be freed).

            Write the body of the function ``init_all``. You must copy the strings.

            *Hint :* Use strcpy.
