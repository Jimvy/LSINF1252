    You are asked to implement the function ``free_all``, which will free all the memory associated with the following structure *university_t*:

    .. code-block:: c

        typedef struct university {
            char* city;
            int  creation;
            person_t* rector;
        } university_t;

    The structure *person_t* is the following:

    .. code-block:: c

        typedef struct person {
            char* name;
            int salary;
            int age;
        } person_t;

    The *name* and the *city* have been allocated with *malloc*.

    *Hint:* all the data may not have been initialised correctly. Therefore, you have to handle all the cases (e.g. some pointers can be already NULL, and don't need to be freed).
