    In this exercise, we will work with operation on bits. When we speak about the position of a bit, the index 0 corresponds to weakest bit, 1 to the second-weakest bit, ...

    In C, you can write a number in binary (base 2) by prefixing it via 0b., e.g. 0b11010 = 26.

    This exercise will introduce some non-standard data types which guarantee that the variable has a fixed number of bits. Indeed, on some machines, a *int* could be 2, 4 or 8 bytes. Hence, if we want to do bitwise operations, we have to know first on how many bits we are working.

    To do so, we introduce two new classes of variable types :

    * *bool* (from <stdbool.h>), which is 1-bit long, hence either 0 or 1
    * *int8_t* (signed integer of 8 bits), *uint8_t* (unsigned integer of 8 bits), *uint16_t* (unsigned integer of 16 bits) ... (you can mix *uint* or *int* with bit-lengths 8, 16, 32 and 64). (from <stdint.h>).
