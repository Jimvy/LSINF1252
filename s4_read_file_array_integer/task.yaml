    Given a binary file containing some (possibly none) positive integers (``int``) that were stored in the file by successive calls of ``write(fd,&num,sizeof(int))`` write a code that computes the sum of all integers that were stored in the file. The function returns the sum when there are no errors. In case of errors, it returns.

    - If ``open()`` fails, return ``-1``.
    - If ``read()`` fails, return ``-2``.
    - If ``close()`` fails, return ``-3``.

    You can only use ``open(2)``, ``read(2)``, ``write(2)`` and ``close(2)``.
