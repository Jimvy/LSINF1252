    *Estimated time: 20 minutes*

    First, read `sections 2.4 to 2.7. in the GNU make manual <https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Variables-Simplify>`_. It will only take you 10 minutes (included in the above given estimated time) and will help you understand how to ``make`` more magic happen.

    As you have just read, one very useful use of Makefiles is to use variables. You can use a variable to define the C compiler you will use and the flags you want it to use.

    For instance, let us consider the following Makefile:

    .. code-block:: console

        # CC variable for C compiler
        # You can replace gcc by clang if you prefer
        CC = gcc
        # CFLAGS variable for gcc/clang flags
        # See gcc/clang manual to understand all flags
        CFLAGS += -std=c99 # Define which version of the C standard to use
        CFLAGS += -Wall # Enable the 'all' set of warnings
        CFLAGS += -Werror # Treat all warnings as error
        CFLAGS += -Wshadow # Warn when shadowing variables
        CFLAGS += -Wextra # Enable additional warnings
        CFLAGS += -O2 -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 # Add canary code, i.e. detect buffer overflows
        CFLAGS += -fstack-protector-all # Add canary code to detect stack smashing

        OBJ = calc.o operations.o

        calc: $(OBJ)
            $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o calc $(OBJ)

        calc.o: calc.c calc.h operations.h
            $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c calc.c

        operations.o: operations.c operations.h
            $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c operations.c

        .PHONY: clean mrproper

        clean:
            rm -f $(OBJ)

        mrproper: clean
            rm  -f calc


    In this file we used 3 variables: ``CC`` to define the C Compiler; ``CFLAGS`` to define the C Compiler flags; ``OBJ`` to define the object files. This is a common use of variables to both simplify the Makefile and easily change the settings of the compiler.

    Notice the use of two ``.PHONY`` targets: ``clean`` which will remove auto-generated files, e.g. object files; ``mrproper`` which will remove both auto-generated & built files, e.g. executable files.

            Remember the  `calculator <https://inginious.info.ucl.ac.be/course/LSINF1252/s2_make_calc>`_ you had to make last week?

            When you typed ``ls`` you had the following folder structure:

            .. code-block:: console

                calc.c    calc.h    Makefile    operations.c    operations.h

            Write a variable called ``OBJ`` to simplify the compilation process in the Makefile.
