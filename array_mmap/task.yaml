    Given a file containing a linked list of the structure *student_t* following, you have to write a function to load the entire linked list from the file and to return a pointer to the head of this linked list. Assume that, in the file, if **a** is followed by **b**, you will have ``a->next = b``.

    .. code-block:: c

        typedef struct student{
            struct student* next;
            int noma;
        } student_t;

    In this exercice, you **cannot** use *fopen*, *read*, *write*, *fread*, *fwrite*, *fgetc*, *fgets*, which means that you must use `mmap(2). <https://sites.uclouvain.be/SystInfo/manpages/man2/mmap.2.html>`_
