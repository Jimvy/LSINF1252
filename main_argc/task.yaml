            Write a complete C program containing a *main*. Your program should print one argument out of two (starting with the first), and return 0. Each argument shall be separated by a space, and the output shall be terminated by a new line. Don't forget the required includes for your program.

            Example :

            .. code-block:: bash

                ./myProg a b c d e f g
                a c e g
        name: ''
        language: c
        default: ''
