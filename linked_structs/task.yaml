    We have a linked list, built with *struct node*.

    .. code-block:: c

        struct node {
            struct node *next;
            int hash;
            int id;
            char name[20];
            char buffer[100];
            unsigned int timestamp;
            char acl;
            short flow;
            char *parent;
            void *fifo;
        }

            We want to filter this list and only take the elements with a pair index (the index starts at 0, hence the first, the third, the fifth, ... elements of the linked list have to be taken), without modifying the initial list.

            Write the body of the function *pair_filter*.

            Hint : man 3 memcpy.

            .. code-block:: c

                /* pair_filter
                 * Make a copy of the linked list starting at head,
                 * only taking one element out of two
                 *
                 * @head : head of a linked list, possibly NULL
                 * @return: pointer to the filtered linked list, return NULL if error or if head == NULL
                 */
