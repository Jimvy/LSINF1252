    In this exercise, we will work with operation on bits. When we speak about the position of a bit, the index 0 corresponds to weakest bit, 1 to the second-weakest bit, ...

    This exercise will introduce some non-standard data types which guarantee that the variable has a fixed number of bits. Indeed, on some machines, a *int* could be 2, 4 or 8 bytes. Hence, if we want to do bitwise operations, we have to know first on how many bits we are working.

    To do so, we introduce two new classes of variable types :

    * *bool* (from <stdbool.h>), which is 1-bit long, hence either 0 or 1
    * *int8_t* (signed integer of 8 bits), *uint8_t* (unsigned integer of 8 bits), *uint16_t* (unsigned integer of 16 bits) ... (you can mix *uint* or *int* with bit-lengths 8, 16, 32 and 64). (from <stdint.h>).

            Write the body of a function that returns the number of bits set to 1 in *i* :

            e.g. *nbits(4) = 1, nbits(7) = 3, nbits(-2) = 2*

            .. code-block:: c

                uint8_t nbits(uint8_t n) {

            Write the body of a function that returns the variable *x*, but with the *pos*-est bit set to *val*.

            .. code-block:: c

                uint64_t set_bit(uint64_t x, int pos, bool val) {
    get_3_leftmost_bits:
        name: get_3_leftmost_bits
        language: ''
        type: code
        header: |-
            Write the body of a function *get_3_leftmost_bits* that returns the 3 strongest bits of *x*. For instance, with *x=11011001...*, the function should return a *uint8_t* containing 00000110.

            .. code-block:: c

                uint8_t get_3_leftmost_bits(uint32_t x) {

            Write the body of a function *get_4_rightmost_bits* that returns the 4 weakest bits of *x*.

            Write the body of a function *unset_last_bit*, which sets to 0 the strongest bit set to 1 it founds, and does nothing if there's no bit set to 0.

                uint16_t get_3_leftmost_bits(uint32_t x) {

            Write the body of a function *cycle_bits*, which moves all bits from *n* places to the left, according to the formula *x[(i+n)%32] = x[i]*, where *x[i]* is the i-iest bit of *x*.
