    Given a file containing a huge array of integers, you are asked to write a function to edit an integer inside the array, and another function to retrieve a specific integer from this array.

    Since the array is huge, you can not load it entirely into memory. Consequently, you have to naviguate directly through the array in the file by using `lseek(2) <https://sites.uclouvain.be/SystInfo/manpages/man2/lseek.2.html>`_.

    You may want to use `fstat(2) <https://linux.die.net/man/2/fstat>`_ to get informations about the file.

    Use only ``open(2)``, ``read(2)``, ``write(2)`` and ``close(2)``.
