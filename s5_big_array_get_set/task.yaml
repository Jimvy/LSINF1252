    Given a file containing a large array of integers, you have to write a function to edit the element at a given index the array and another function to retrieve a specific element from this array.

    Since the array is huge, you cannot load it completely in memory. Consequently, you have to naviguate directly through the array in the file by using `lseek(2)`_ .

    You may want to use `fstat(2)`_ to obtain informations about a given file.

    Use only `open(2)`_, `read(2)`_, `write(2)`_ and `close(2)`_ and `lseek(2)`_
