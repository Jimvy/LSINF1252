    You have just built a calculator, whose source folder has the following structure:

    .. code-block::

        src/
            calc.c
            calc.h
            operations.c
            operations.h

    `calc.c` contains the calculator which handles the 4 basic operations: addition, substraction, multiplication, and division. These 4 operations are implemented in `operations.c`.

    Unfortunately, the source folder was lost but you still have access to the object files (`.o`).
